      not change the member data).

	Ensure all MPI ranks read all files while ensuring that
	no two ranks simultaneously read the same file.
	
	Let MPI_Size be denoted n. If n is 1, no messages are sent and
	the single rank always reads the files in order. When n is
	larger than 1, rank 0 still reads the files in order. Rank n-1
	begins by reading the second file, rank n-2 begins by reading
	the third file, and so on, until there are no more ranks left
	which are not reading files or there are no more files left.
	After reading, all ranks which read files send a message to
	the next rank (in sequence) prompting them to proceed with the
	next file. Once each rank has read all of the files, it does
	not send or receive any further messages (the number of
	messages sent for n>1 is n times the number of files times).
	If \ref settings::mpi_load_debug is set to 1, then the various
	MPI messages are copied to scr_out, no files are actually
	read, and exit() is called after all messages have been sent
	and received by all ranks.
