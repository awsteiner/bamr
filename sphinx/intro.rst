Introduction
============

This user's guide describes the open-source MPI implementation of
a Bayesian analysis of mass and radius data to determine the mass
versus radius curve and the equation of state of dense matter.
This package will principally be useful for those physicists and
astrophysicists who are already familiar with C++ and are
interested in modifying this code for their own use. This 
documentation was generated from git commit

This code was originally supported by Chandra grant
`TM1-12003X
<http://cxc.harvard.edu/target_lists/cycle12/theory12.html#12400566>`_
and is now supported by NSF grant `PHY 15-54876
<http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1554876>`_.

Currently, bamr is hosted as a `git repository
<http://www.github.com/awsteiner/bamr>`_ . It is also listed at the
`Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) <http://ascl.net/1408.020>`_
and at the `ADS <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ascl.soft08020S>`_
. This HTML documentation is hosted `here
<http://web.utk.edu/~asteine1/bamr>`_ . While you are not required to
do so, please consider citing the ASCL entry following the method
described on this `post <http://ascl.net/wordpress/?page_id=351>`_ , and the
relevant references in the bibliography below.

If you are considering using this code for your research, I encourage
you to contact me so that I can help you with the details and so that
you can let me know if and how this code is useful to you.
Nevertheless, you are not required to contact me and I will be
improving documentation and updating this code as time permits.
